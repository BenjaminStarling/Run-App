Instructions

This program was created in the IDE Pycharm which is a free IDE. If you are
having issues running the code make sure that you have all of the Python
libraries pip installed. Most of the time if the libraries are not 
installed they will be underlined in red at the beginning of the program. 
If you hover your curser over the underlined library an option to install
the library will appear and will make the process easier then installing
using the terminal and pip.

To run the program you will just press run and if everything is installed 
app will take a few seconds to open and then the gui will open.
The user will select the time they want to run and walk for and how many 
cycles they will do as well. Then they will press start and the cycles 
will begin with run and then walk.
