Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program was created in the IDE Pycharm which is a free IDE. If you are
having issues running the code make sure that you have all of the Python
libraries pip installed. Most of the time if the libraries are not 
installed they will be underlined in red at the beginning of the program. 
If you hover your curser over the underlined library an option to install
the library will appear and will make the process easier then installing
using the terminal and pip.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the program you will just press run and if everything is installed 
the app will take a few seconds to open and then the gui will open.
The first page will be a login or sign up page, this is where the user 
will create their account or login depending if they have one or not. The 
next page has three buttons the workout button, the workout history button, 
and the account button. In the workout button, the user will select the 
time they want to run and walk for and how many cycles they will do as well. 
Then they will press start and the cycles will begin with run and then walk.
The next button, workout history, just shows the past workouts that the 
user has done. Lastly, the account button, just shows the account username
and also has a log out button that allows the user to logout.
